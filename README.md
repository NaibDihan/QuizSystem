# Project Title: Simple Quiz Software System Java Project

## Project Summary: In this software system, there are two types of users: Admin and Student. The Admin can save multiple MCQs with four options and their answer keys in a quizes.json file. When any student logs in to the system, the system will prompt the student to take an MCQ exam from the quiz bank. If a user logs in with admin credentials, the system will prompt the admin to add new questions to the question bank. If a user logs in with student credentials, the system will prompt the user to take a quiz. 

## Key Features:
- From the admin end, the admin will keep adding questions to the quiz bank (quizes.json) until he or she stops by pressing the 'q' key.
- The questions from quizBank (quizes.json) are shuffled randomly.
- From the student's end, the student can take a quiz exam. Ten random questions will appear each time he or she takes the quiz.


## Prerequisites:
- JDK LTS Version
